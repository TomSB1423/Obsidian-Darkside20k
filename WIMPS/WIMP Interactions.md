  ## WIMP-X interactions:
-   WIMP-electron: Ar atom ionized and electron pings around - generates a large light pulse
-   WIMP-nucleus: nucleus does not travel far - generates a small point pulse
-   You can see this difference in the pulse shape (intensity vs time), also the charge transport can help distinguish between nuclear vs electron recoil -> look at the gaseous phase of the detector for information about the electron cascade. See [[S1 & S2 Signals]]
-   Specifically to WIMP as you expect it to hit a nucleus rather than an electron, as much bigger target

## Three signatures for WIMP interactions in the detector
However 2/3 are impossible to measure.

1.  Directionality of nuclear recoil - best possible signature but impossible to measure
	- We know that there is a big ball of dark matter around of our galaxy, so depending on the particle track of the vast majority of WIMP-like events occur will give an indication whether these are likely [[WIMPs]]
	- However the track of nuclear recoil is not measurable - less than micrometre -> would have to measure this to figure out this is a WIMP

2.  Annual modulation of rate - impossible
	- Due to earths rotation around the sun we would see the energy spectrum of the WIMP-like events wobble periodically (up and down every year)
	- Would expect this to change by a few percent
	- Impossible to measure as way too little, also would only occur once a year
	- To measure this you would plot a graph of x: recoil energy, y: number of events
3.  Material dependence - most practical signature to look for
	- Nuclear scattering profile looks different on different materials
		- This is nuclear recoil â†’ we expect a distribution of scatters and will end up with a nuclear elastic scattering plot of y: Counts vs x: Recoil Energy. This would look different for every particle and over time you would see a spread of plots:

	- Called material signature
	- Once we know the signal for WIMP-like events in Argon, we can extrapolate this data and then look for it in Xenon. If we find that the mass is the same then we can hypothesis that these WIMP-like events are in fact WIMPs.
		- We would then extrapolate the data to see if the rate matches the mass needed/predicted in the galaxy
		- This would show strong evidence for WIMPs
