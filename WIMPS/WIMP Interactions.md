  ## WIMP-X interactions:
-   WIMP-electron: Ar atom ionized and electron pings around - generates a large light pulse
-   WIMP-nucleus: nucleus does not travel far - generates a small point pulse
-   You can see this difference in the pulse shape (intensity vs time), also the charge transport can help distinguish between nuclear vs electron recoil -> look at the gaseous phase of the detector for information about the electron cascade. See [[S1 & S2 Signals]]
-   Specifically to WIMP as you expect it to hit a nucleus rather than an electron, as much bigger target
