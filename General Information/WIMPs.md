-   Direct detection in shielded underground detectors
	-   On earth
-   Indirect detection with satellites, balloons, and ground-based telescopes looking for signals of dark matter annihilation -> usually in galaxy centres where lots of dark matter is thought to exist
	-   PAMELA satellite-borne experiment
		-   Positron excess in cosmic rays - suggested to be evidence of dark matter annihilation
	-   Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS)
	-   Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
		-   Shown that emission from from the galactic centre cant be described by background models - suggested to be dark matter annihilation
	-   Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)
		-   Sensitive to high energy photons from the inner Milky Way and dwarf galaxies due to thermally annihilating dark matter particles up to 10 TeV/c2
	-   PINGU extension to ICECUBE
		-   Annihilation of low-mass WIMPs (down to 5 GeV/c2 ) in the Sun and the galactic centre would be detectable, if funded
-   Detection at particle colliders where dark matter particles may be directly produced in high-energy collisions.
	-   LHC, ATLAS, and CMS:
		-   They initiate pp collisions and look for a large momentum imbalance (as dark matter is thought to be heavy - WIMP)
		-   However due to the high energies, it means that these detectors inhibit a loss in sensitivity - above a few hundred GeV/c^2
