## Interim Report
### Project intro (7 pages)
- What is dark matter and why is background important [[Dark Matter Candidates.pdf]]
	- Start with particle candidates of dark matter, motivation for existence
	- Evidence: Uneven distribution for galaxy 
			- Figure of this
	- Types: Hot, cold, WIMP, Axion (don't go into too much depth of this)
	- WIMP specifics + methods of detection, we are using direct detection [[WIMP Interactions]]
	- High sensitivity → solar neutrinos
	- Necessity of background suppression
- [[Darkside-20k]] and previous detector summary
	- How DarkSide approaches DM detection → [[TPC]], [[S1 & S2 Signals]], [[Argon]], [[Veto]]
	- Want to talk about electron and nuclear recoils 
		- Darkside does not ignore electron recoils -> electron recoils are interesting at low energies
		- Tritium produces electron recoils
- Motivation for experiment
	- Muon-induced spallation
	- Where are muons produced - talk about muon secondaries
	- More sensitive detector so need to account for everything
	- Too much tritium in xenon could be an explanation (look for xenon collaboration in the title in the past two years, look for xenon excess of events)

### Summary of Work Done (2 pages, probably 1 page)
#question 
Talk about studying dark matter
chain of action
first person
bullet points?

### Term 2 Workplan (1 page)
- #question 
- Mention DUNE
- Using ROOT framework and geant4 to create a catalogue of interactions
	- production yields and uhhh something else -> look at dune
	- look at which ones are relevant -> long lived radioactive isotope
	- Which ones are dangerous -> looking at production yields in different parts of the detector
	- What is left in the TPC is going to be dangerous
- Use location physics to determine if the interaction products will cause any significance in reading detection
- Becomes more computational
