## Project intro
- What is dark matter and why is background important
	- Hot, cold, WIMP, axion
	- Low energy
	- High sensitivity → solar neutrinos
- [[Darkside-20k]] and previous detector summary
	- How Warwick is involved with darkside #question 
- Motivation for experiment
	- More sensitive detector so need to account for everything
	- Too much tritium in xenon could be an explanation
- Muon interactions with liquid argon

## Summary of Work Done
#question 

## Term 2 Workplan
- Mention DUNE
- Using ROOT framework and geant4 to create a catalogue of interactions
- Use location physics to determine if the interaction products will cause any significance in reading detection
