## Interim Report
### Project intro (7 pages)
- What is dark matter and why is background important [[Dark Matter Candidates.pdf]]
	- Evidence: Uneven distribution for galaxy 
	- Types: Hot, cold, WIMP, Axion 
	- WIMP specifics + methods of detection [[WIMP Interactions]]
	- High sensitivity → solar neutrinos
	- Necessity of background suppression
- [[Darkside-20k]] and previous detector summary
	- How DarkSide approaches DM detection → [[TPC]], [[S1 & S2 Signals]], [[Argon]], [[Veto]]
- Motivation for experiment
	- Muon-induced spallation
	- More sensitive detector so need to account for everything
	- Too much tritium in xenon could be an explanation (look for xenon in the title in the past two years, look for xenon excess of events, this is not DEAP experi)

### Summary of Work Done (2 pages)
#question 

### Term 2 Workplan (1 page)
- #question 
- Mention DUNE
- Using ROOT framework and geant4 to create a catalogue of interactions
- Use location physics to determine if the interaction products will cause any significance in reading detection
