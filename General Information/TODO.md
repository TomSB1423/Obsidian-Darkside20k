## ABSTRACT:


## INTRODUCTION:
- Do probably need to know how material signature can be used to identify WIMPs -> I have written this quite vaguely
- Muons are not mentioned in darksides papers -> not considered for background 
	- Only DS-50

## METHODOLOGY:
- What is simulated peak muon energy?

## RESULTS:
- Neutron scattering -> where do neutrons come from, only from ?
- Are beta+ of any significance?
- Does electron capture & alpha have Q-values?
- Why are yields much higher than DUNE? Is darkside bigger?
	- DUNE -> 1.5 per muon, 1 (66%) is unstable
	- Darkside -> 10 per muon, 3, (33%) is unstable
**- Add to XENON1T experiment talking about why tritium was so important and what we have found** 

## CONCLUSION:
- Comment on how DS needs low background events < 0.1 yr
- Uncertainty is likely to be out by a factor of 2 due to the hadronic processes
- Lots of isotopes produced
	- Dominant in heavy isotopes but typically too large q-values
- Only some significant, for both electron recoil and nuclear recoil
	- Total counts per year
	- total counts per muon
- Fiducial volume doesn't really do much - looking at tritium
- Confirms XENON1T experiment 
- In order for DS to reach its full potential, it needs to recognise the possibility for muon spallations to produce radioactive isotopes that may later decay.
