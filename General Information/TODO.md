**ABSTRACT:**


**INTRODUCTION:**
- Talk about anti-neutrinos and if they are significant? -> they are not I think
Technical design report:
- Nuclear Recoil-background rates -> p94 
- Electron Recoil-background rates -> p105 

**METHODOLOGY:**
- Explain how number of decays were calculated - i think time was one year?

**RESULTS:**
- $^8Li$  decays into $^8Be$ -> production method
- 

**CONCLUSION:**
