## ABSTRACT:


## INTRODUCTION:
- Do probably need to know how material signature can be used to identify WIMPs -> I have written this quite vaguely
- Muons are not mentioned in darksides papers -> not considered for background 
	- Only DS-50

## METHODOLOGY:

## RESULTS:
- Neutron scattering -> where do neutrons come from, only from ?
- Does electron capture & alpha have Q-values?
**- Add to XENON1T experiment talking about why tritium was so important and what we have found** 

## CONCLUSION:
- Comment on how DS needs low background events < 0.1 yr
- Uncertainty is likely to be out by a factor of 2 due to the hadronic processes
- Lots of isotopes produced
	- Dominant in heavy isotopes but typically too large q-values
- Only some significant, for both electron recoil and nuclear recoil
	- Total counts per year
	- total counts per muon
- Fiducial volume doesn't really do much - looking at tritium
- Confirms XENON1T experiment 
- In order for DS to reach its full potential, it needs to recognise the possibility for muon spallations to produce radioactive isotopes that may later decay.

**Comments:**
Ben Watkins: Overall it seems like a sick report - difficult to make comments on the content since I hvae no clue what's going on most of the time but I'm sure for the markers it'll be more clear. A couple things:

Ben Watkins: Sort out your references! in the report they go 5 then 25 then 1 etc. so just put them in order.

Ben Watkins: Talk more about uncertianties in the results section - every number you quote should have an associated uncertainty

Ben Watkins: Make sure that you're making it completely clear what you're doing in this report, and link back to it at the end

Ben Watkins: some of the paras are a bit long, split them up maybe?

Ben Watkins: well done lad
