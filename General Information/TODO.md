**ABSTRACT:**


**INTRODUCTION:**
- Talk about anti-neutrinos and if they are significant? -> they are not I think
Technical design report:
- Nuclear Recoil-background rates -> p94 
- Electron Recoil-background rates -> p105 

**METHODOLOGY:**
- Explain how number of decays were calculated - i think time was one year?
- Aim to create table of isotopes 
	- Electron and nuclear recoils
- What does FTFP stand for?

**RESULTS:**
- On average 10spallation products per muon -> 3 being unstable 
- $^8Li$  decays into $^8Be$ -> production method
- Can electrons produce nuclear recoils?
- Neutron scattering -> where do neutrons come from, only from ?

**CONCLUSION:**
