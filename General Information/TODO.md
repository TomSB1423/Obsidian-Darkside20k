**ABSTRACT:**


**INTRODUCTION:**
- Do probably need to know how material signature can be used to identify WIMPs -> I have written this quite vaguely

**METHODOLOGY:**
- What does FTFP stand for -> what do I say if it is arbitrary?
- What is simulated peak muon energy?

**RESULTS:**
- Can electrons produce nuclear recoils?
- Neutron scattering -> where do neutrons come from, only from ?
- Are beta+ of any significance?
- Does electron capture have Q-values?
- mention about only need low q-values

**CONCLUSION:**
- Lots of isotopes produced
- Only some significant, for both electron recoil and nuclear recoil
	- Total counts per year
	- total counts per muon
- Fiducial volume doesn't really do much - looking at tritium
- Confirms XENON1T experiment
