**ABSTRACT:**


**INTRODUCTION:**
- Talk about anti-neutrinos and if they are significant? -> they are not I think
Technical design report:
- Nuclear Recoil-background rates -> p94 
- Electron Recoil-background rates -> p105 
- Do probably need to know how material signature can be used to identify WIMPs -> I have written this quite vaguely

**METHODOLOGY:**
- What does FTFP stand for -> what do I say if it is arbitrary?
- What is simulated peak muon energy?

**RESULTS:**
- Can electrons produce nuclear recoils?
- Neutron scattering -> where do neutrons come from, only from ?
- Are beta + of any significance?
- Does electron capture have Q-values?
- mention about only need low q-values

**CONCLUSION:**
