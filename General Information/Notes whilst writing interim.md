## TODO
- Intro should be something more like this
	- https://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.4849.pdf
- Indirect vs direct detection
	- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03800.pdf
	- [Indirect detection refers to astrophysical signals?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/587038/direct-and-in-direct-measurments)
- Might be worth taking a look at the cross section, also maybe take figure on p35/38: https://s3.cern.ch/inspire-prod-files-e/e4a72b7ea77289ca3eaa2e4d4f7184e3

## Words to use
- non-luminous
- promising candidate is the WIMP
- Scintillator
- Resolve the directionality of a recoil
- powerful metric for discriminating WIMP recoils from terrestrial background - copied!
- anisotropy/isotropy
- emphasis on "“instrumental background-free” experiment"


## Questions that arise
- Isn't direct detection just the same as indirect detection?
