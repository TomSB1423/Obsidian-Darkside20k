## TODO
- Intro should be something more like this
	- More fluff/story
	- https://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.4849.pdf
- Indirect vs direct detection
	- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.03800.pdf
	- [Indirect detection refers to astrophysical signals?](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/587038/direct-and-in-direct-measurments)


## Questions that arise
- Isn't direct detection just the same as indirect detection?
