# Abstract
- Overview
- Look at DUNE paper
- Comment on background free experiment

# Introduction
#### Evidence for Dark Matter
- Expand on gravitational lensing + galactic rotation curves
- Maybe subsection on both?

#### Dark Matter Candidates
- Ask Yorck if this is a succinct description of dark matter, or need to expand more on each candidate?

### Detection Methods
- Emphasise low background physics
- WIMPs are anything that is unknown at this point?
- Link to detectors and state how they use background mitigation techniques

#### Background sources
- Ask Yorck if these are really the only two non-reducible sources of dark matter experiments
- Necessity of background suppression

#### WIMP Signatures
- Are there any more signatures?

### DarkSide Collaboration
- Just expand on each section

# Methodology
- Use parts of interim report + DUNE paper
- Geant4 simulation generates ROOT output
- Analysed using root and python
- Subsequent geant4 simulations were run with different physics models

# Results
- Ask Yorck what errors do we have?
- Look at DUNE
- Show table & comment on relative abundances
	- Only highest yields
- muon spallation caused heavier isotopes to form
- Analysis of Background rejection
	- Prompt doesn't mean anything
	- delayed
	- percentage rejected

### Tritium production
- No tritium produced
	- Insight into xenon1 experiment - might not be from muons
	- So extra simulations run with different physics models

# Conclusions
