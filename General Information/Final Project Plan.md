# Abstract
- Overview
- Look at DUNE paper
- Comment on background free experiment

# Introduction
#### Evidence for Dark Matter
- Expand on gravitational lensing + galactic rotation curves
- Maybe subsection on both?

#### Dark Matter Candidates
- Ask Yorck if this is a succinct description of dark matter, or need to expand more on each candidate?
- 
#### Detection Methods
- Emphasise low background physics
- WIMPs are anything that is unknown at this point?
- Link to detectors and state how they use background mitigation techniques

#### Background sources
- Ask Yorck if these are really the only two non-reducible sources of dark matter experiments
- Necessity of background suppression

#### WIMP Signatures


- [[Darkside-20k]] and previous detector summary
	- How DarkSide approaches DM detection â†’ [[TPC]], [[S1 & S2 Signals]], [[Argon]], [[Veto]]
	- Want to talk about electron and nuclear recoils 
		- DarkSide does not ignore electron recoils -> electron recoils are interesting at low energies
		- Tritium produces electron recoils
- Motivation for experiment
	- Muon-induced spallation
	- Where are muons produced - talk about muon secondaries
	- More sensitive detector so need to account for everything
	- Too much tritium in xenon could be an explanation (look for xenon collaboration in the title in the past two years, look for xenon excess of events)
