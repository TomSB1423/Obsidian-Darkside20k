- Writing our own ROOT files
	- Identify isotopes
	- Classify into long lived and short lived ~ look at experiment definition
- Root TChain inherits from TTree
	- Look up specific examples -> best way of learning
- Root also has a visual method -> `StartViewer()`
	- Though will want to write about code rather than viewer in the report
- Simulations so far are purely production simulations
	- Write ions produced from muon decays to disk
	- No tracking of the history
- Time information is useful in determining if dangerous or not
