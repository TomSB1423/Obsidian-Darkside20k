## Work Done
- Working on drawing in TGeoManager
	- [Opening GDML file](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/geometry-package-gdml/20796)
	- 
- Good guide to Geant4 [tracks](https://confluence.desy.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=188789339)

## Meeting
- Can we go over why both electron and nuclear recoils are important?
- What conclusions can we draw from these results
- What is the difference between a track and their daughter track in the ROOT files
- Q-value is max energy available for decay
- Edep dosen't really man anything
- Muon energy spectrum "stiffens" as we get lower and lower
- Start looking for long lived dangerous isotopes
	- Tritium
	- any beta decays
	- or high energy gamma rays in buffer that might penetrate 
	- Muon flux at grand-sasso
- Play with trajectory data
	- Look at last production method for isotope
	- Production of an ion triggers write to disk & starts with muon
	- [Germanium enriched double beta experiment](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6079-3)
- Neutron lifetime in geant4 is set to 2ms
