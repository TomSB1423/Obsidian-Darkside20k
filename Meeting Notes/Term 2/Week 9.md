# Work Done
- Tried doubling the deadtime to see effect on counts per volume:
```
Buffers:
No: 181
Total Counts: 191335006
Total Production (yr): 6595484.522578421
Number of stable isotopes: 39
Number of unstable isotopes: 142

TPC Prompt:
No: 170
Total Counts: 79525683
Total Production (yr): 2741319.6483971043
Number of stable isotopes: 39
Number of unstable isotopes: 131

TPC Delayed:

- Didn't make any difference - > Same number of isotopes produced & counts did not change at all
- Started writing the report & making results tables


# Meeting
- How to represent EC, IT, and beta followed by neutron/alpha particle in table:
- 
- Tried plotting energy distribution:

	- ![[Pasted image 20220302183913.png|500]]
- What is muangle
	- ![[Pasted image 20220302210513.png|500]]
-  Found Be 4-8 which ALPHA decays?!
- How much memory does the simulation output use?
