## Work Done
### Tables generated:
- [Complete isotope volume + counts](https://imgur.com/a/iUBAEtp)
- Prompt TPC - not too much an issue as are ignored due to deadtime
	- [Prompt TPC counts](https://imgur.com/a/u417TAB)
- Look for beta decay + excess yields
	- [Delayed TPC counts](https://imgur.com/a/nT14Bd2)
- Look for high energy gamma in outer buffers:

### Conclusions
- Found no Tritium anywhere! -> speak to Yorck about this
	- Other physics models -> currently use Shielding model
- No Isomeric transition for any decay -> no high energy gamma rays released anywhere
	- But could it just be possible that an ion is created and recombination creates a gamma ray?
	- Does this mean nothing to worry about in the outer buffer?
- By using 3 volumes and ignoring all prompt events can excluded ~84.11% of events ($1-(27.7\% * 57.2\%)$)
	- Delayed vs prompt split

	- Total counts pretty much split into thirds over 3 different volumes:

- Buffers high q-values:
