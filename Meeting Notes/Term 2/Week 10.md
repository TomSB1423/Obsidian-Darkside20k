## Work Done
- Writing report

## Meeting
- Tritium location production -> Ayesha
- What to say about 1222 decays per year?

- Why are yields much higher in DS than DUNE? Is DS bigger?
	- DUNE -> 1.5 per muon, 1 (66%) is unstable
	- DS -> 10 per muon, 3, (33%) is unstable
- Can electrons produce nuclear recoils?
- Neutron scattering -> where do neutrons come from, only from detector materials?
- Are beta+ of any significance -> annihilation is MeV?
- Does electron capture & alpha have Q-values?
- What does FTFP stand for -> what do I say if it is arbitrary?
- What is simulated peak muon energy?
- Go over material signature of WIMPs
