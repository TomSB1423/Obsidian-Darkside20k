## Work Done
- Writing report

## Meeting
- Tritium location production -> Ayesha
	- This is wrong
- What to say about 1222 decays per year?
	- Nothing
	

- Why are yields much higher in DS than DUNE? Is DS bigger?
	- DUNE -> 1.5 per muon, 1 (66%) is unstable
	- DS -> 10 per muon, 3, (33%) is unstable
	**DUNE is much deeper so makes sense**
- Neutron scattering -> where do neutrons come from, only from detector materials?
- Are beta+ of any significance -> annihilation is MeV?
	Nope just two 511MeV photons
- Does electron capture have Q-values?
	Yes, it can produce anything

- What does FTFP stand for?
	fritiov string model
- What is simulated peak muon energy?
	
- Go over material signature of WIMPs


- Can talk about the cm cut limits high energy particles
- Expand on why shielding model is used
	Look at supernemo experiment as they use that
- The factor two is a systematic error
Sub-dominant error in the energy and angular distribution to the systematic error in the actual physics simulation

Darkside-50 didnt find sulphur -> it mainly focused on inherrent 
Write that beryllium is delayed
	Also decays into two alpha particles
	if these are neutral then could initiate NR, but very unlikely
	Alpha are charged so would probably look like 
Low yield isotopes for neutron decay
	High energy looks like exp decay
	Any neutron is dangerous
- Electron capture -> not too significant though produces lots of different things and has Q value


Can talk about removing user cuts loosing some data
Could use FLUKA in future to get more accurate data


- Viva, first question: tell us what you have done 5 min
