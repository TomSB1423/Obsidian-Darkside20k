- Does decays in the TPC cause another prompt/delayed cycle or is it only buffers?
	- No it doesn't

- What is "no cuts"?
	- This is something to do with length that an ion travels
	- Done to save time
- Is this correct? How much liquid argon is in the experiment?
	- The UAr is contained within a sealed titanium vessel, and immersed within a bath of 700 t of 2655 atmospheric liquid argon, AAr
	- Yes it is

- What is the range of energies we look for? both electron & nuclear recoil
	- 
- Are we interested in beta decay because of the free electron? -> is this the S2 signal or an S1 too?
- deposit background in the energy region of interest, from threshold to maybe 100 keV
- Can all prompt isotopes be ignored

- Using figures from the internet in your report


- Obviously nuclear reactions to create heavier exotic isotopes
- Tritium production is known to be in spallation muons
	- Geant4 does not include these models
	- could be that geant4 has consumed the tritium
		- Isotope + Triton reaction to produce exotic particles

- Compare to DUNE paper
	- Tell examiner about different muon flux
	- Different shape of volume but compare to target mass
- Critical assessment of your own research

- Do yields per muon
