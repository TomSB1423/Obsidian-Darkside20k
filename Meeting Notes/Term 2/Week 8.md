# Meeting
- Does decays in the TPC cause another prompt/delayed cycle or is it only buffers?
- What is the range of energies we look for? both electron & nuclear recoil
- What is "no cuts"?
- Is this correct? How much liquid argon is in the experiment?
	- The UAr is contained within a sealed titanium vessel, and immersed within a bath of 700 t of 2655 atmospheric liquid argon, AAr
- Any recommendations on selecting gammas and varies on intensity
- Are we interested in beta decay because of the free electron?
- deposit background in the energy region of interest, from threshold to maybe 100 keV
- Using figures from the internet in your report?
