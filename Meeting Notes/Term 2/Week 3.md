- Lots of IDEs installed on nenneke: Genie, Emax, Spyder...
- You have to type ROOT into the terminal/cmd to get the root graphics loaded, the root graphics library is called Tgeo so you can do some research about how to use it if you want to
- The objects that you need to get used to using are TChain, TCanvas for any histograms or visuals
- Ideally we want to start trying to write code in root, the goal overall is to catalogue the isotopes
- Also although the intro to root on the cern website isn't too useful, in the reference documentation, you'll find examples of code and that is really useful because the syntax is a bit weird to get used to and it's good to see how each function should be used

Very useful website -> all isotopes chart: https://wwwndc.jaea.go.jp/CN14/index.html
For finding isotopes with Z&N number: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/116889/computer-parsable-table-of-nuclides & https://github.com/jhykes/nuclide-data
