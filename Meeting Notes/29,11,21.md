#question When talking about cross-section with that image â†’ why is everything above, excluded?
	if excluded then would have seen in the detector
	cross-section vs wimp mass
	where as if neutrino fog is included in the plot then we have neutrino energy on the x-axis
#question What is cross section? is it the probability of seeing it? They why is it not just dependent on time?
	Dependent of time and area
#question Where is tritium mentioned in the DEAP experiment? paper? [[Overview of different detectors and tritium.pdf]]
	Not the DEAP experiment, just xenon collaboration
	
	
	
The WIMP miracle -> found that wimp force was weak force if wimp mass 1-1000GeV. So always look in this range. They have a max KE due to boltzman distribution -> calculated from how WIMPs stay in the center of the galaxy, this is escape velocity
