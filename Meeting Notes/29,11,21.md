#question When talking about cross-section with that image â†’ why is everything above, excluded?
	if excluded then would have seen in the detector
	cross-section vs wimp mass
	where as if neutrino fog is included in the plot then we have neutrino energy on the x-axis
#question What is cross section? is it the probability of seeing it? They why is it not just dependent on time?
	Dependent of time and area
#question Where is tritium mentioned in the DEAP experiment? paper? [[Overview of different detectors and tritium.pdf]]
