Distinguishing between electron/nuclear recoil with S1 and S2 signals: [[DarrenPrice_DMUK_DarkSide20k.pdf#page=6]]
S1 signals:
	Photon flash
	Recombination at source
S2 signals:
	Electrons that start drifting up from source due to electric field
	Vertical electron drift -> this is also a photon flash, not current signal as would traditionally be
	Much larger due to electron cascade acting like an amplifier
	gives a 2D readout from the plane
Electron recoils:
	More electrons?
	Smaller Photons?
Nuclear recoils:
	More photons?
	less electrons?
