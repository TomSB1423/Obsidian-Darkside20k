Distinguishing between electron/nuclear recoil with S1 and S2 signals: [[DarrenPrice_DMUK_DarkSide20k.pdf#page=6]]
S1 signals:
	Photon flash
	Recombination at source
S2 signals:
	Electrons that start drifting up from source due to electric field
	Vertical electron drift -> this is also a photon flash, not current signal as would traditionally be
	Much larger due to electron cascade acting like an amplifier
	gives a 2D readout from the plane

Electron recoils:
	More electrons?
	Smaller Photons?
Nuclear recoils:
	More photons?
	less electrons?

Dual Phase TPC [[Paolo Agnes - pagnes_DMUK21.pdf#page=4]]
	2 discrimination methods:
		PSD - looking at decay constant of S1
		Ratio of S1 & S2

Gamma rays release from every neutron capture in Ga acrylic 
	Can learn about neutron background - this means a neutron will have been stopped
	
#TODO Take a look at NEXO project about muons and their xenon experiment - double beta decay
