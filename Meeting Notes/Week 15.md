Simulation output to ROOT
ROOT is C++ / python though not sure for python
electron recoil for low energy WIMPS
mainly looking for beta decay as alpha decay not likey as isotopes have low mass
Then once identified the main isotopes to look for simulate again with same geometry however
	now with that isotope distributed as expected and see is significant to WIMP detection
batch selection: slorm (SCRTP wiki)
	sq command - lists every schedule on all command
