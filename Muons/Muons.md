-   Similar to the electron
	-   charge of −1e
	-   spin of 1/2
	-   much greater mass -> 207 times that of the electron
-   Mean lifetime of 2.2 μs
	-   Longer than other particles
	-   Decay is slow as only weak interaction
-   Decay almost always produces at least three particles
	-   Electron of the same charge as the muon
	-   Two types of neutrinos
-   Due to their heavier mass they accelerate much slower than electrons and emit less bremsstrahlung radiation
	-   Can penetrate much deeper into matter
-   Secondary muons created by cosmic rays
-   Not produced by radioactive decay as have such a high energy
-   Produced in great amounts in high-energy interactions in normal matter
	-   Produce pi mesons initially, which almost always decay to muons → but would never find any pi mesons in the detector as these decay way too quickly
-   Cross-section for interaction

**4 basic processes of muon interactions:**
-   Ionization (including production of high-energy -electrons)
-   Production of electron-positron pairs
-   Bremsstrahlung
-   Inelastic muon interaction with nuclei
-   Muon decay
	-   Would be unlikely to be found in the detector
