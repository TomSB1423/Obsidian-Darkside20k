Briefly talked about Cherenkov radiation, how do we discriminate?

What is background
	Electron and nuclear
	Muons are expected to yield rare background
	Wasn't background before as in 50k as sensitivity not as high
	Now may as well have a look for it and investigate whether it is is worth accounting for
Give reference to independent motivation from Xenon experiment with unresolved electron recoil excess
Refer to DUNE

Faraday cage is between passive cryostat and outerbuffer
Neutrons can basically get anywhere in the detector as they are neutral and if they move fast enough.
Ga when neutron absorbed releases photon and this is what the inner buffer shields from
neutrinos interactions produce electron recoils
