What is the aim of creating a catalogue of muon interactions?
- For the interim report, mention examples of the interactions between muons and argon
- only really interested in products that are long lived
	- these could decay later and then decay producing a light flash, seemingly out of no where
	- This is where tritium comes in

After muon goes in ionization releases light and then there is a deadtime where the 
	Veto detector sees this first then raises a 'flag' then ignores everthing after in time window
Going to try several different production methods using Geant4 and compare

- Two components combined to create an S1 signal? What are they?
