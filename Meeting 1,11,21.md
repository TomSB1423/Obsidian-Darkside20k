What is the aim of creating a catalogue of muon interactions?
- For the interim report, mention examples of the interactions between muons and argon
- only really interested in products that are long lived
	- these could decay later and then decay producing a light flash, seemingly out of no where
	- This is where tritium comes in

After muon goes in ionization releases light and then there is a deadtime where the 
	Veto detector sees this first then raises a 'flag' then ignores everything after in time window
Going to try several different production methods using Geant4 and compare

WIMP interactions always have nuclear recoils
If radioactive left over material have only beta and gamma emission then muons are not a big deal. However up to a point... we still have electron recoils (come generally from beta and gamma decays) this could be and example of light dark matter (pushing their energy threshold down)- But now there is no discrimination between electron recoil and background. Also gamma rays can go through the TPC acrylic and cause these electron recoils.



- Two components combined to create an S1 signal? What are they?
	-   

- In principle more energy going into S1 than S2 as takes less energy to produce S1, why?
