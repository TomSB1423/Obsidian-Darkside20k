# What is Dark Matter?
No one talks about specific particles -> no one really knows what they are looking for anymore.
## General Background
-   Is not matter that we can see
	 -   Not made up of baryons → as would be able to detect this by absorption of radiation
	  -   Not antimatter as don’t see gamma rays produced in annihilation
-   The matter that we can see does not create enough gravitational pull to explain the universes expansion
-   Made the conclusion that it only interacts gravitationally
-   For example that galaxies would fly apart/not form due to their rotation (Kepler's second law)
-   By fitting a theoretical model of the composition of the universe to the combined set of cosmological observations, scientists have come up with the composition that we described above, ~68% dark energy, ~27% dark matter, ~5% normal matter.
-   Does not come from planets/stars/clouds of normal matter
-   Not galaxy-sized black holes → Do not see enough gravitational lensing to suggest the 25% dark matter
-   Classified as "cold", "warm", "hot" according to its velocity (free streaming length)
	-   Cold → Moves slowly (axions and neutralinos), WIMPs - high mass as low velocity
	-   Warm → intermediary
	-   Hot → Travels with ultrarelativistic velocities (neutrinos), low mass as high velocity
	-   However they have a maximum speed and therefore likely slow
-   Observations show that there is too little visible matter to make up the 27%
-   Is classed as matter as the energy density scales with the inverse cube, as opposed to radiation which is inverse fourth power
-   However does not behave like regular matter → only see effects on large scales and only with gravity

## Classifications
-   [[WIMPs]] (weakly interacting massive particles) → yr: 1985, mass: 1-1000GeV
	-   Considered to be one of the main candidates for cold dark matter
		-    Large mass, they would be relatively slow moving and therefore "cold"
	-   Not defined in the standard model → may disprove this model if found to be true
	-   Interacts with gravity but weaker/as weak as the weak nuclear force
	-   Non vanishing in its strength
	-   Evolution → At an earlier point in time (higher temp) the dark matter particle and its antiparticle would have been forming from and annihilating into lighter particles. As the universe expanded and cooled, there would not be enough energy to generate to particle-antiparticle pairs.

-   Axion → yr: 1977, mass: 1x10^-5 eV (very small)
	-   Although lots of them, thought to have been produced in large quantities in the big bang
	-   Originally came up with to solve CP symmetry
	-   ADMX experiment
	
-   Sterile neutrino → yr: late 1970s, mass: ~1GeV
	-   New flavour of neutrino, only interacts with gravity
	-   MiniBooNE experiment
	-   Could be the start of an entire unstandardized model

-   SIMPs (strongly interacting massive particle) -> yr: 2014, mass: 0.1GeV
	-   SuperKEKB experiment
