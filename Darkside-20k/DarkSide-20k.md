## Location 
- It will be installed in LNGS Hall-C and will either detect WIMP dark matter or reach a 90% exclusion sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross sections of 7.4x10-48cm2 at the mass of 1TeV/c2. [Labratori Nazionali](https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/darkside)

## Overall Structure

The detector consists of three separate volumes:
- An inner volume of active liquid AAr, called the Inner argon Buffer (IAB), surrounding the TPC
- A passive shell of acrylic loaded with Gd, called the Gd-loaded Acrylic Shell (GdAS), of octagonal shape mounted around the TPC. The IABis in between the TPCand the GdAS. The GdAS surrounds the TPC in all the directions (lateral, top and bottom, with exceptions due to the signal and utility service holes).
- An outer active volume of atmospheric argon, called the Outer Argon Buffer (OAB).
