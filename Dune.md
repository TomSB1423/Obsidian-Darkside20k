-   Major background is expected due to muon spallation of argon

	-   Produces isotopes that later beta decay

-   Paper presents the spallation backgrounds in argon, with isotope production mechanisms and decay properties
-   Spallation backgrounds can be powerfully rejected by simple cuts
-   Advantages

	-   Huge detector 20kton of Lar
	-   Excellent capabilities in event reconstruction
	-   Charged-current detection isolates the electron neutrino

		-   Main detection channel
		-   Much larger cross section
		-   Sharper correlation between neutrino energy and electron energy

-   When cosmic ray muons pass through the detector they produce secondary particles which occasionally break argon nuclei and make other isotopes

	-   Unstable isotopes beta decay which can mimic neutrino signals

-   Goals for this paper:

	-   Calculate the spallation backgrounds for DUNE in detail
	-   Understand physical mechanisms
	-   Use this understanding to develop cuts to reject backgrounds

-   Overview of Spallation

	-   Almost all isotopes are made by muon secondaries
	-   Secondaries are made in showers which are rare along muon tracks
	-   Almost all the isotope-producing secondaries are made in hadronic showers, which are even rarer
	-   Muons lose energy in two ways:

		-   Ionization
		-   Radiative losses → produce the most secondary particles, rate rises with energy

			-   Dominant radiative processes: pair production and bremsstrahlung

		-   Photonuclear interactions, a lowQ2 analogue to deep inelastic scattering, are less frequent
