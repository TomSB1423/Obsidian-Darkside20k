## Types of specialized dark matter detectors:
-   Cryogenic bolometers with ionization or scintillation detection
-   Bubble chambers
	-   PICO @ SNOLAB â†’ uses heated liquid with latent heat (bubbles formed when particle interaction) and listen to particle interactions
-   Point contact germanium detectors
-   [[Liquid xenon detectors]]
-   Liquid argon detectors
	-   [[DarkSide Project]]

Also have [[Dune]] (Deep Underground Neutron Experiment) although this isn't a dark matter detector - it is similar to our project task
