## Location 
- It will be installed in LNGS Hall-C and will either detect WIMP dark matter or reach a 90% exclusion sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross sections of 7.4x10-48cm2 at the mass of 1TeV/c2. [Labratori Nazionali](https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/darkside)

## Overall Structure

-   Outer ProtoDUNE-like cryostat to contain temperature (LAr)
-   Copper shell #question - <u>Where is this located?</u>
	-   Acts as Faraday cage
	-   Optically and electrically isolates the 
-   Outer Argon Buffer (OAB)
	-   All encased in an outer active volume of atmospheric argon
	-   This is passive at the moment but want to install light detectors - not enough funding for this
-   Passive Gd Acrylic Shell
	-   <u>Helps with keeping E-field very homogeneous -> thin film metal field shaping rings </u> #idk
	-   GdAS moderates neutrons emitted from all of the detector materials, particularly from the ones which make-up and surround the LAr TPC
	-   The Gd enhances neutron capture probability
	-   
-   Inner Active Veto (LAr)	
	-   
-   Acrylic TPC Wall & PDM and mechanics
	-   
-   TPC

- Two detectors:
	- Inner detector
		- Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr TPC)
		-  Filled with UAr
	-  Veto detector
		-   Made of a plastic shell, loaded with Gd, surrounding the inner detector, sandwiched between two active AAr layers

-   Abandons organic liquid scintillator veto
	-   Due to significant performance advantages
	-   Removal of this means that no cryostat is needed

## Detectors

### Veto Detectors
The veto detector consists of three separate volumes:
- An inner volume of active liquid AAr, called the Inner argon Buffer (IAB), surrounding the TPC
- A passive shell of acrylic loaded with Gd, called the Gd-loaded Acrylic Shell (GdAS), of octagonal shape mounted around the TPC. The IABis in between the TPCand the GdAS. The GdAS surrounds the TPC in all the directions (lateral, top and bottom, with exceptions due to the signal and utility service holes).
- An outer active volume of atmospheric argon, called the Outer Argon Buffer (OAB).
- All of the inner surfaces of the Veto, including the external walls of the TPC and the walls of the vertical sectors, will be covered with reflector foils coated with wavelength shifter (TPB), so that the VUV argon scintillation light is shifted to longer wavelengths where the LAr is very transparent.
	- Then trapped for multiple reflections untill it reaches a SiPM

### TPC
- The LAr TPC operates in a two-phase mode, utilizing both the liquid and gas phases of [[argon]]
