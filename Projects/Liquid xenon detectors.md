# XENON-1T collaboration
-   Has obtained the most sensitive limits on spin-independent interactions of WIMPs with nuclei, using a xenon target to place a limit on the WIMP-nucleon interaction cross section of 7.7 × 10−47 cm2 for a WIMP mass of 35 GeV/c2
-   The region of cross section around 10−39 cm2 expected for Z-mediated scattering seems to be fully explored now - and excluded.
