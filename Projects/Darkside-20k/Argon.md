## Why use Argon?
Liquid argon is advantageous as a sensitive medium for several reasons:

-   Economical, Argon-40 is most abundant and not radioactive
	-   However there are other sources of Argon - Ar-39 is found in abundance in atmospheric Argon
	-   UAr (Underground Ar) used in [[TPC]] to avoid radiation
	-   AAr (Atmospheric Ar) used in [[Veto]] as more economical and can mediate any radioactive decays using acrylic for TPC walls
-   The fact that argon is a noble element and therefore has a vanishing electronegativity means that electrons produced by ionizing radiation will not be absorbed as they drift toward the detector readout. 
	-   -   Transports charge well - nontrivial as not metal. We are measuring light and charge in the [[DarkSide-20k]] detector
-   [[DUNE]] - discriminates entirely with the light pulse rather than the conduction -> so [[DarkSide-20k]] is trying to use both
-   Argon also scintillates when an energetic charged particle passes by, releasing a number of scintillation photons that is proportional to the energy deposited in the argon by the passing particle. 
-   Liquid argon is around one thousand times denser than the gas used in Nygren's TPC design, which increases the likelihood of a particle interacting in a detector by a factor of around one thousand. [TPC wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_projection_chamber)
-   Noble element - electrons are not absorbed → useful for conduction detection method
-   Is a good scintillator - produces lots of light -> PSD uses the light for detection
-   Media is transparent to their own light, so can build big detectors - nontrivial as absorption is not the same as emission lines
