## Location 
- It will be installed in LNGS Hall-C and will either detect WIMP dark matter or reach a 90% exclusion sensitivity to WIMP-nucleon cross sections of 7.4x10-48cm2 at the mass of 1TeV/c2. [Labratori Nazionali](https://www.lngs.infn.it/en/darkside)

## Overall Structure
General structure:
- Outer [[Veto]]
- Inner [[TPC]]

A comprehensive list made from outside → inside:
-   Outer ProtoDUNE-like cryostat to contain temperature (LAr)
-   Copper shell #question - <u>Where is this located?</u>
	-   Acts as Faraday cage
	-   Optical and electric shield for reducing external noise from contaminating the detector signals
-   Outer Argon Buffer (OAB)
	-   All encased in an outer active volume of atmospheric argon
	-   This is passive at the moment but want to install light detectors - not enough funding for this
	-   #question - <u>What does this do?</u>
-   Passive Gd Acrylic Shell
	-   Helps with keeping E-field very homogeneous -> thin film metal field shaping rings #question - <u>Is this true? Where are the metal field shaping rings found?</u>
	-   Gd-loaded Acrylic Shell (GdAS) moderates neutrons emitted from all of the detector materials, particularly from the ones which make-up and surround the LAr [[TPC]]
	-   The Gd enhances neutron capture probability
-   Inner Active Veto (LAr)	
	-  Allows for reliable predictions of the number of neutron-induced recoils expected #question - <u>Is this correct?</u>
-   Acrylic [[TPC]] Wall & PDM and mechanics
	-   Again, acrylic mediates neutrons to avoid [[Nuclear Recoil]] mostly produced from the slightly radioactive LAr in the [[Veto]]. The nuclear recoils could be mistaken for [[WIMP interactions]]
-   [[TPC]] (UAr - underground Argon → contains no Ar-39, only Ar-40 which is not radioactive)

-   Abandons organic liquid scintillator veto - I think this was either previously done in DUNE/DS-50?
	-   Due to significant performance advantages
	-   Removal of this means that no cryostat is needed
