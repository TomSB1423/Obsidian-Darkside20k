### Veto Detectors
The veto detector consists of three separate volumes:
- An inner volume of active liquid AAr, called the Inner argon Buffer (IAB), surrounding the TPC
- A passive shell of acrylic loaded with Gd, called the Gd-loaded Acrylic Shell (GdAS), of octagonal shape mounted around the TPC. The IABis in between the TPCand the GdAS. The GdAS surrounds the TPC in all the directions (lateral, top and bottom, with exceptions due to the signal and utility service holes).
- An outer active volume of atmospheric argon, called the Outer Argon Buffer (OAB).
- All of the inner surfaces of the Veto, including the external walls of the TPC and the walls of the vertical sectors, will be covered with reflector foils coated with wavelength shifter (TPB), so that the VUV argon scintillation light is shifted to longer wavelengths where the LAr is very transparent.
