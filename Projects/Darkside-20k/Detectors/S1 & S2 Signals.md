# Signals in the Detector
Categorized into two groups:
-   S1 → 
	-   Used for [[Energy Determination]] and for [[PSD]]	
	-   In principle more energy going into S1 thanS2 as takes less energy to produce S1
-   S2 → Secondary scintillation signal
	-   Proportional to the ionization charge
	-   Used for energy and 3D position determination
	-   Vertical coordinate measured from the drift time between S1 and S2
	-   The horizontal coordinate measured from the light pattern on the top photosensors
	-   S1 + S2 = constant -> using both improves your energy resolution
	-
