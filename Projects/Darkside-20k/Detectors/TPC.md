## TPC (Time Projection Chamber)
- TPC delivers three-dimensional track information 
- The UAr TPC operates in a two-phase mode, utilizing both the liquid and gas phases of [[Argon]]
- An acrylic vessel will be used to confine the UAr rather than a metallic vessel, since acrylic is extremely pure, with a residual neutron background estimated to be as low as <10−3 100 t yr^−1 [[TDR_DarkSide-20k.pdf]]
-   Uses e&B fields to reconstruct the particles trajectory or interaction
-   Can detect both the scintillation light and the ionization electrons produced by recoiling nuclei due to properties of [[Argon]]
-   Need high detection efficiency for nuclear recoil events
-   Define a fiducial volume to get rid of background #misplaced
	-   This is volume that is cared about
	-   Ignore volume around the edge of the TPC
	-   In absence of this fiducialization, surface background and background from Cherenkov events originating in the PMTs fused silica and in the Teflon reflector dominate

## Structure
-  Consists of a octagonal container filled with UAr
-  Sides coated with wavelength shifter
-  Densely packed arrays of SiPMs above the anode and below the cathode fully cover the top and bottom faces of the TPC to detect both [[S1 & S2 Signals]] → 2605 photon detection channels each
-  Transparent conductive Indium-tin-oxide cathode (ITO) at the bottom and grid just below liquid surface which separates electron drift and extraction regions.
-  Region above liquid is bounded by a flat diving bell shaped ITO anode electrode at the top which supplies a voltage to produce a vertical electric fields to drift the ionization electrons upwards
-  Homogeneous electric field running along the axis of the cylinder established between anode and cathode plates on top and bottom of the chamber
	-   There are independent electric fields between the grid and anode which creates the fields to extract the electrons into the gas and accelerate them to create a secondary scintillation called electroluminescence which gives S2 signal

## Measurements
Two main types of interactions:
- Nuclear [[Recoils]]
- Also have Electron [[Recoils]]
