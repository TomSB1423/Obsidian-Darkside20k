## TPC (Time Projection Chamber)
- TPC delivers three-dimensional track information 
- The UAr TPC operates in a two-phase mode, utilizing both the liquid and gas phases of [[Argon]]
- An acrylic vessel will be used to confine the UAr rather than a metallic vessel, since acrylic is extremely pure, with a residual neutron background estimated to be as low as <10−3 100 t yr^−1 [[TDR_DarkSide-20k.pdf]]
-   Uses e&B fields to reconstruct the particles trajectory or interaction
-   Can detect both the scintillation light and the ionization electrons produced by recoiling nuclei due to properties of [[Argon]]
-   Need high detection efficiency for nuclear recoil events
-   Define a fiducial volume to get rid of background #misplaced
	-   This is volume that is cared about
	-   Ignore volume around the edge of the TPC
## Structure
- Consists of a octagonal container filled with UAr
- Sides coated with wavelength shifter
-   Densely packed arrays of SiPMs above the anode and below the cathode fully cover the top and bottom faces of the TPC to detect both S1 & S2 signals → 2605 photon detection channels each
- Homogeneous electric field running along the axis of the cylinder established between anode and cathode plates on top and bottom of the chamber
