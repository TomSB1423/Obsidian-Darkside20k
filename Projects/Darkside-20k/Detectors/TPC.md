## TPC (Time Projection Chamber)
- The UAr TPC operates in a two-phase mode, utilizing both the liquid and gas phases of [[Argon]]
- An acrylic vessel will be used to confine the UAr rather than a metallic vessel, since acrylic is extremely pure, with a residual neutron background estimated to be as low as <10−3 100 t yr^−1 [[TDR_DarkSide-20k.pdf]]
-   Uses e&B fields to reconstruct the particles trajectory or interaction
-   Can detect both the scintillation light and the ionization electrons produced by recoiling nuclei due to properties of [[Argon]]
-   Need high detection efficiency for nuclear recoil events

## Structure
- Consists of a octagonal container filled with UAr
- SiPM on top and bottom
