The prompt decay time is typically a couple of nanoseconds, while the delayed decay time is normally on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds. The majority of the light is produced by the prompt decay; however, the amount of light in the delayed component often varies as a function of the type of particle causing the excitation (Knoll 2000). The variation in the amount of light produced by delayed fluorescence can be utilized to distinguish different types of particles; this technique is known as pulse shape discrimination (PSD)
