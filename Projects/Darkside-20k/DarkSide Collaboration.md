1. DarkSide-10 → smallest volume
	- 10kg of LAr
	- Operated for 7 months
	- Princeton University

2. DarkSide-50
	- 46kg argon target mass![[TDR_DarkSide-20k.pdf]]
	-   Dual-phase argon TPC (time projection chamber) → uses E & B fields with a sensitive volume of gas/liquid to perform a 3D reconstruction of a particle trajectory of interaction.

3. [[DarkSide-20k]]
	-   Being made as evidence suggest that background free results can be produced from a larger exposure with a multi tonne detector
	-   Actually 51.1 t of argon
	-   20.2 t of liquid argon (fiducial volume), designed to operate with zero backgrounds, meaning that all sources of instrumental background are reduced to <0.1 events over a 200 t yr exposure

4. Argo
	-   Future experiment
	-   Predicted exposure of 1000 t yr free of background
	-   Well be sensitive to neutrinos at the "neutrino floor" (produced by the sun)
